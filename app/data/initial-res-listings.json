Park your boat out front, unload your bikes & lake toys, and make yourself at home as you enjoy the peace and nostalgia of Lost Bridge Village. This adorable cabin features an open kitchen and living area with a dining nook & island seating. Relax in the bright and open living room after a day on the water. There are two bedrooms and a large (newly added) bunkroom for sleeping. Enjoy dinners outside in the screened-in porch as you watch the sun set and deer graze. Stroll down to the park, pool, & community center and enjoy the lake from there or the shoreline behind the community center. Play pickleball or tennis on our brand-new courts! Got a plane? Fly in and land on the LBV airstrip. Only 3 miles to Lost Bridge Marina. Short drive to Rogers, Pea Ridge, & Eureka Springs. Don't miss this great opportunity- they don't come around very often at this price!",
